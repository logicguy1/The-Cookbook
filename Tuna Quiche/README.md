## Ingredients
* 4 eggs
* Milk
* 1 yogurt
* 1 or 2 tomatoes
* 1 can of tuna
* Mustard
* A roll of puff pastry
## Materials
* A pie plate
* An oven
* A big bowl
## Method
1. Cut your tomatoe(s) in slices.
2. Take a big bowl and put the eggs, the yogurt and a little bit of milk. Be careful, do not put too much milk or it will be too liquid.
3. Mix everything together.
4. Turn on your oven on 200°c.
5. Take the puff pastry and put it in the pie plate. 
6. Cover the bottom with mustard. I like to put a lot of mustard as it gives more taste to the quiche.
7. Open the tuna can. Crumble the tuna on the quiche, covering the bottom entirely.
8. Add the tomatoe slices.
9. Pour in the mix from step 2.
10. Put your quiche in the oven for 20 to 25mins. Be careful to check if the puff pastry is cooked before turning off your oven!

Quiche are great for moments when you're too lazy to cook food. It's a simple and fast recipe and it's delicious!
## Discussion
You can use this recipe and change the ingredients. For example, instead of making a tuna quiche, you can make a spinach one! Just replace the tuna with cooked spinach and tomatoes with goat cheese. You need to put the sliced goat cheese on top of the spinach, the oven will grill them! ;D
