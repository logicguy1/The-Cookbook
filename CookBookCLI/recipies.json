Again, see for yourself if you like your cookies very sweet or medium like me :)  \nThen, when it comes to the chocolate, I like to do 50% milk chocolate and 50% dark chocolate. It balances well between the sweeteness of the milk chocolate and the bitterness of the dark one.  \nFinally, if you don't have hazelnuts (or you just do not enjoy them) you can replace them with 100g of sesame seeds."}, "Barlel": {"meta": {"author": "Nouille#2370", "category": "Desserts", "cook_time": "15 minutes", "portions": "Unkowen"}, "ingredients": [{"name": "Flour", "amount": "100", "unit": "grams"}, {"name": "Fine wheat semolina", "amount": "225", "unit": "grams"}, {"name": "Salt", "amount": "1", "unit": "pinch"}, {"name": "Yeast", "amount": "1", "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"name": "Baking powder", "amount": "1", "unit": "pack"}, {"name": "Water", "amount": "600", "unit": "ml"}, {"name": "Honey", "amount": "1", "unit": "tablespoon"}, {"name": "Olive oli", "amount": "1", "unit": "tablespoon"}], "materials": ["A hand blender", "A big bowl", "A pan"], "method": ["Prepare the yeast by dissolving a little bit of sugar in lukewarm water.
