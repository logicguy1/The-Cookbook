## Ingredients
- 1 eggplant üçÜ
- 1 Squash
- Flour
- Chili flakes (optinal but not really)
- Paprika, orgeno and basil
- Salt and pepper
- 4 medium eggs
- 1 onion
- ~750 mL of blended tomatoes, fresh, canned or in a glass is not important just smooth it out with a stand blender
- A bag of graded mozerella cheese (this stuff gud)
- Some olive oil

## Materials
- A sauce pan / pot
- A pan
- A 30x30 cm deep dish (5 or 6cm)

## Method
1. Chop the onion into cubes and cook it up in the sauce pan with some olive oil
2. While the onions are going start cutting the eggplant and squash into slices about 0.005 m (0.5 cm)
3. Once the onions are going translucent add the tomato sauce and the spices, orgeno, basil, chili flakes, Salt and pepper to taste, give it a kick. Let it simmer whille we prep the rest
4. Once the greens have been sliced take out a pan and two bowls, fill the first bowl with a layer of flour, i like to spice things up and add chili flakes, paprika and some Salt and pepper.
5. Fill the other bowl with 2 eggs and break the yoaks and combine with a fork.
6. One at a time take the eggplants, dip in the eggs then in the flour, covering both sides, fry it in a bit of oil in the pan.
7. Start layering the lasanga while frying, i add a little sauce at the bottom for lubrication, then it goes eggplant, squash, sauce, cheese and repeat. Only add a tiny bit of cheese as most of it will be going on top.
8. Once finished with they layering (use all the greens) add the rest of the cheese on top with a bit of oregeno and some chili flakes (i like chili) and pop it in the oven at 473.15 K (200 C) for 20 - 25 minutes, pull it out when the cheese starts to crip and gets a little brown (see pic)

## Conclusion
Its actually a really good dish, my filosofy on veggie dishies is often that you shouldnt try to be something that you arent, dont try to be meat if you arent meat. This dish is not trying to be a lasanga, but simply trying to be good.

## Discussion
This recipie was suggested to me by my teacher Karen, so shoutout to karen, she came up with the idea of frying the eggplants to give the dish some structure. It was kinda whipped out in a night i was home alone so a lot of improvements can properbly be made, PRs are always welcome if you think something is missing.

You chould properbly add some garlic to the sauce if you like that. But i honestly think it has enught on it's own.
