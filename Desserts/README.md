# NYC Strawberry Cheesecake
I usually crave for some cheesecake at the beginning of each summer. However, my cheesecakes usually ended up being too dense. I therefore tried to find the perfect cheesecake recipe. This is when I found Joshua Weissman's recipe. It is simply perfect, I will link his video if you want to go check it out. I did make some changes though, for my own taste (and maybe yours).

## Ingredients
#### Crust ingredients
<br>100g tea biscuit
<br>100g speculoos biscuit
<br>65g butter
<br>2g coarse salt
<br>Nutmeg (optional)
<br>
#### Filling ingredients
<br>900g cream cheese
<br>200g sugar
<br>4 eggs +1 egg white
<br>60g fromage blanc (similar to quark)
<br>60mL whole liquid fresh cream (30%)
<br>7g vanilla
<br>20g cornstarch
<br>A pinch of salt
<br>
#### Strawberry jam ingredients
<br>450g strawberries
<br> 100g sugar

## Materials
<br> Round mold (around 22cm)
<br> Electric whisk
<br> 2 big bowls

## Method
### Crust method
<br>1. Preheat the oven at 160°c.
  2. Finely crush the biscuits in a bowl and mix in sugar, nutmeg and salt.<br>
  3. Add melted butter and mix. <br>
  4. Pour the biscuits in the mold and press with a flat glass. <br>
  5. Place in the oven for 8mins, then let it cool completely. <br>
### Jam method
<br>1. Cut the strawberries in halves and put in a medium pot with the sugar.
  2. Mix and let sit for 15mins. <br>
  3. Turn on medium heat. Let it cook for 10mins, stir regularly. <br>
  <i>Filling method</i>
<br>1. Mix cream cheese with sugar in a bowl until creamy.
  2. Add the eggs one by one, ending with the egg yolk. <br>
  3. Once fully incorporated, add fromage blanc, whole liquid cream, salt, vanilla and cornstarch.<br>
### Assembling
<br>1. Grease the sides of your mold.
  2. Pour the filling over the fully cooled down crust.<br>
  3. Put the cheesecake on an oven plate and fill it with boiling water. It should come up around 2cm of your mold's sides. Be careful, if you use a springform pan you should add tin foil to the bottom while making sure it covers more than 2cm of the sides. Otherwise, water will get in your cake (and we don't want that).<br>
  3. Put everything in the preheated oven (160°c) for 1 hour 30mins. The cheesecake must be set but slightly jiggly.<br>
  4. Turn off the oven and let sit for 45mins, with the oven door open<br>
  5. Take the cheesecake out and let it cool.<br>
  6. Add the strawberry jam on top.<br>
  7. Let sit for 2-3 days in the fridge.<br>

## Discussion
### Tips for the strawberry jam
Take about 1/3 of your jam and blend it, then mix your blended strawberries to the rest of jam.
### Variation
I personnally like to replace strawberries by blueberries. In this case, I highly recommend adding rose water. It is just so good and goes very well with blueberries. However, you should dilute a teaspoon of cornstarch in a glass filled with any amount of rose water you want. It will prevent the jam from becoming too liquid.
