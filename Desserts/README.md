# NYC Strawberry Cheesecake
I usually crave for some cheesecake at the beginning of each summer. However, my cheesecakes usually ended up being too dense. I therefore tried to find the perfect cheesecake recipe. This is when I found Joshua Weissman's recipe. It is simply perfect, I will link his video if you want to go check it out. I did make some changes though, for my own taste (and maybe yours).
