I recently watched a video by `Helen Rennie` *(full credit to her for testing and creating the recipe)*
If you want to watch the video you can find it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_fu5RaXMVk)

The recipe calls for:
 - 300 g flour (preferbly 00 flour)
 - 185g wet ingredients

The wet ingredients are made with the following:
 - 2 large eggs
 - 3 large yolks
 - Enough water to get to the 185g messurement

You want to add the flour in a food processor together with the wet ingredients and 2 tablespoons of salt  
When the dought is finished in the food processor, set an 8 minute timer and start kneading the dough  
The kneading should _not go like with a bread dough_ but by folding a small amount of doing and pressing down-forward, keep fingers clear, make sure it does not stretch too much and break underneath
**After a minute** if the dough sticks to the counter add a tablespoon of wheat and continue kneading until it's fully incorperated.

When the kneading is done, cut the dough into 4 and wrap 3 of the pieces tightly in wrap.  
Press the remaining dough piece into the height of about 1 - 1.5 cm
Feed it into the pasta roller on the `level 1` setting. When done fold it like the pixel art below
```
                                |                         |   ********\
                                |   /********             |   /*******|
********* ********* *********   |   \******** *********   |   \*******/
```
And put it through the machine, you can't run it 90 degrees every time. Once the dough forms a rectangle you can contineue by putting it to level 2 and running it through 2 times, make sure the dough does not get too sticky if so, add flour to each side of the dough. Repeat until you get to level 6. If the dought gets too long and becomes unconfortable to handle, cut it.

At last we have a nice dough that just needs to be cut, i usually use the cutter attachment on my pasta maker for this but you can also use a knife
