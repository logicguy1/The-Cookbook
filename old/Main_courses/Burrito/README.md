## Ingredients  
- 6 - 8 Large totials  
- 800 grams of gorund beef  
- 460 grams Tex-Mix chunky salsa  
- A can of corn  
- 150 grams mozerella chees, or whatever is avaliabe  
- Spinach  
- Chili  

You might want to make rice and a good salad to include as a side

## Materials  
- A pot  
- A large deep oven safe cooking tray (I use one with 5 cm walls)  

## Method  
1. Brown the meat in a pan with a bit of olive oil
2. Set the oven to 473.15 K (200 C)
3. Once the meat has browned, add the salsa, corn and chili, let that cook in
4. Lay a totilia on the pan and fill it with some meat, spinach and cheese, you want a little meat and cheese leftover when you are done, repat this for each pancake untill the pan is filled
5. Once all the totilias are closed and in the pan you want to dibble som meat and top with cheese
6. Insert the tray into the oven, beware that all the ingredients are already cooked so this step is mostly for melting the cheese
