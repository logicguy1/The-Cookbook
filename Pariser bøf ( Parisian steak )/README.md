## Ingredients
* 400g ground beef or beef tatare if you're fancy

* 4 pieces of toast

### Other toppings could include
* Diced red onion
* Diced rabede
* etc

## Materials
* Nothing special, just a pan

## Method
1. Start by forming the patties, they should be big enough to at least cover the toast bread
2. Season with salt and pepper
3. Heat up a pan with butter and cook the patty until they are golden brow
4. In the fats of the paddies toast the bread untill they are crisp on both sides you may need to add more butter here
5. Plate the pariserbøf with capers, grated horseradish and an egg yolk each, it can be a good idea to put the egg yolk on first so the rest of the toppings stick to the meat

## Conclusion
You will be presented with a really good "man" dish it might not be something to serve on a first date but for a football night with the boiz there is nothing better

## Descussion
You can of cause vary how much meat / garnish to add or remove depending on you're taste
