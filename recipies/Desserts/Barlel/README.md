1. Prepare the yeast by dissolving a little bit of sugar in lukewarm water. Add the yeast and smash it with a fork. After 5-10mins, the yeast should foam which means it's still active.  
2. Put all of the ingredients in the big bowl, including the prepared yeast.  
3. Blend everything together.  
4. Heat your pan and put a ladle of you preparation in it.  
5. Bubbles should appear on top of your Barlel. You don't need to flip it as it cooks all the way up.  
6. Remove your Barlel from the pan once it's fully cooked. You can tell by touching with your hand. It should be soft and yellowish.  
7. Put some olive oil and honey on it. Be generous!  
8. Roll it and eat!  

## Conclusion  
Barlel is a moroccan recipe. It looks like pancakes but with several holes, that's why we call it "crÃªpes with thousand holes" in french. It is often offered to guests when they come to visit!
Barlel is a simple recipe which do not need any hard method. Anyone can make it!  

## Discussion  
- I personnaly like to use walnut oil instead of olive oil sometimes. It has a very different taste and will diversify your Barlel! ;D  
- Barlel is good served with moroccan tea.
