<h2> Ingredients </h2>

<li>Chicken breast</li>
<li>Mushrooms</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>1 onion</li>
<li>Salt</li>

</ol>
<h2> Materials </h2>

* 2 frying pans
* 2 bowls

<h2> Method </h2>

1. In a bowl, pour olive oil (I would say at least 3 tablespoons), half a teaspoon of salt, cumin, paprika and ginger. Mix.
2. Add the chicken breast in and soak it in the mix. Flip the chicken breast and put the mix everywhere on the meat. Cover the bowl and put it in the fridge for 20mins.
3. Slice your mushrooms and your onion.
4. Cut your chicken breast in cubes.
5. Rinse your rice. 
6. Take a pan and stir in the chopped onion with some olive oil. Once they turn yellow, add in the meat. Let them cook.
7. Add the mushrooms in.
8. Check if your mushrooms are cooked. If they are, add the rice.
9. Let the rice cook for 2mins and stir it at the same time.
10. Add tomato sauce. Mix and let everything cook for 2 more minutes.
11. Turn off the heat and take a bowl. Crack the eggs, add some salt and tabasco sauce. Stir everything in.
12. Take an other frying pan and pour in the eggs. Be careful to spread everything well and make sure your omelette isn't too thin. It will depend on the size of your pan.
13. After 1min, put 2 tablespoons of your rice mix on the middle of your omelette. 
14. Take the borders of your omelette and fold them on the rice. Flip everything upside down by rolling it.
15. Take a plate and put your omurice in. 
16. Add some ketchup on top.

<h2> Conclusion </h2>

Omurice isn't too hard to make except for the final steps, you might break your omelette quite a few times. With some practice, these steps won't be a problem anymore!

<h2> Discussion </h2>

I like to add sesame seeds and provencal herbs to my omelette. You can add whatever you like in your eggs :)) <br>
I know that japanese like to pour mayonnaise instead of ketchup on top of their omurice sometimes. Try both and you'll see which one is your fav! :D <br>
If the pan technique is too hard for you, you can use a bowl to make your omurice:
* Gently put your omelette in a bowl (be careful not to break it)
* Judging from the size of your bowl, add a few spoons of rice. There should be enough place to fold your omelette on top.
* Fold the borders of your omelette to close everything.
* Put your bowl upside down on a plate and voilà!
